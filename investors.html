        <h3>We are looking for ...</h3>
        <p>Visionary investors who align with our mission and values and prioritize long-term societal change over short-term financial gains. Ideal partners bring a track record in mission-driven or socially impactful projects and offer access to robust networks that foster synergies, growth, and partnerships. Experience in the Peacetech sector is welcome, but we also appreciate those who understand our vision and want to support it – creating collaborative innovations ready to develop groundbreaking and economically successful solutions with us.</p>

        <h3>We do not work with ...</h3>
        <p>Investors who have a political, radical, or controversial background, are associated with arms or other potentially conflict-promoting industries, or act solely in political and short-term interests. We also distance ourselves from investors who are solely focused on financial returns without a cultural contribution and whose expectations or conditions contradict our values. Trust, credibility, and alignment with our mission are the cornerstones of all our partnerships.</p>
