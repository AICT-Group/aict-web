            <h2>Key Features – The Disruptive Approach of AICT Peaceflow</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>All-In-One</strong><br>Peaceflow combines various methods of conflict intervention – including mediation, negotiation, coaching, and mentoring. This opens up entirely new perspectives and solutions, even for conflicts that change dynamically over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Pro-active Dialogue</strong><br>Peaceflow acts proactively, takes initiative, provides impulses, and clearly distinguishes itself from conventional LLM chat systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity and Inclusion</strong><br>Conflicts often arise in complex ways from many interconnected and interacting strands of action and reaction. They are influenced by cultural and linguistic differences, personal expectations, experiences, and perspectives...<br><br>Therefore, we train Peaceflow with a wide range of very diverse global data to best map human behavior, emotional states, and conflict dynamics. This includes, for example, knowledge about indigenous communities, marginalized societal groups, and pathological research.</li>
                <li><strong>Individual Avatars and Negotiation Settings</strong><br>Peaceflow adapts the negotiation avatar in character and language to the preferences of the participants and suggests specific negotiation settings and environments. This fosters trust and increases the chances of successful conflict resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation and Contracts</strong><br>Peaceflow documents conflict resolution processes upon request. For binding agreements, these can be prepared in writing and sent directly to relevant legal representatives for finalization.</li>
                <li><strong>Conflict Prevention</strong><br>By analyzing complex real-time data and maintaining a deep understanding of conflict origins, Peaceflow will be able to detect potential disputes at an early stage. Based on this, it can simulate effective counter-strategies and propose concrete preventive measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Training</strong><br>Thanks to its comprehensive knowledge and understanding of conflict, Peaceflow becomes a sparring partner and personal coach for successful communication in negotiation, crisis, and conflict situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Open Source for Transparency and Collaboration</strong><br>Peaceflow is being developed as an open-source project. This creates transparency, builds trust, and fosters innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Quantum-Cloud Technology – Next Level Security & Performance</strong><br>We rely on continuous technological advancement and are evaluating the use of hybrid quantum-cloud technology.<br><br>Our goal is to increase machine learning training performance and conduct complex analyses and simulations of conflict dynamics in real time. Quantum cryptography could also offer an unprecedented level of security for data storage and transmission.</li>
                <li>The AICT Group offers itself as a network partner in peace and behavioral research.</li>
